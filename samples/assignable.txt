type arr : 1 -> integer

        The 'reserve <assignable>;' pattern here is just used 
        as the easiest way to reach an "assignable" reduction for testing. 
        It may or may not represent meaningful program flow. However, the 
        grammar is valid.

    (* The simplest assignable is an identifier, eg x *)
    reserve x;

    (* 
        A function call is "assignable" but it CANNOT be assigned to 
        This is assignable because the syntax represents array access as well
    *)

    reserve x(true);
    reserve x(y);
    reserve x(y, 7, x);
